15;15;15;4.4;True to size. If between I'd probably go with your lower end i.e 8-8.5 go 8.

22;22;22;2.8;Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week! I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that weren’t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking.;2/23/2019;35;FALSE;51;Transsexual Person;Beans - Wax
23;23;23;3.7;I would NOT recommend these for running. They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe. They are also shaped really weird. The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should.;9/14/2015;18;TRUE;75;Bigender;Blouse / Shirt / Sweater
24;24;24;3.4;These shoes are cute online but in person...not so much.The shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling.  Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward.  Not a nice look.  At that point I decided that I didn't want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time.  I'm returning them.;4/21/2020;72;FALSE;28;Cisgender Female;Bread - Pumpernickel
25;25;25;3.7;Very comfortable! Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. They run slightly too big. But, that doesn't take away from the comfort. I'm not sliding around inside them. I'm able to work in them well and workout in them great. Excellent pair of shoes.;7/27/2015;1;FALSE;54;Gender Questioning;Oil - Olive, Extra Virgin
26;26;26;2.0;I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day.  Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragon’s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.  Dilemma, should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work.  So disappointing.;1/28/2021;42;TRUE;32;Transsexual Female;Mikes Hard Lemonade

It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with ""dress"" pants, but for business casual, it's good. I'm always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well.

30;30;30;3.9;I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks, it's not all the time, but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 10-15 min, also the laces don't seem to stay tied, my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces.... besides that, I think the shoes are really cute, love the choice of brown and blue, I think they work well together, also the shoe has pretty good support, I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe, but like I said if you don't, the original inserts are pretty good;8/22/2020;32;TRUE;83;Cisgender Female;Eggplant Oriental
31;31;31;3.7;I bought these as a birthday present for myself. I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes. The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though.

32;32;32;3.8;I was so excited to find these shoes. They are super cute!  They were too small, however, and I cannot find the larger size I need.

They run big. I wear a women’s 7 in most shoes. I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it, I should get a 6.5. I got the 6 because they didn’t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out. They’re big. I measured them against the men’s 7 I had from the store and there wasn’t much difference between the 6 and 7. They measured the same as the men’s 6.5 I had from the store. I would’ve ordered a 5 if they were available. It’s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation.

241;241;241;1.1;I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear. Sorry Dan post, I gotta move on.;10/07/2015;18;FALSE;60;Cisgender Man;Star Anise, Whole
242;242;242;4.7;I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain. I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought I’d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. I’ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot I’ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, that’s unheard of and if you’re a Boot Person you know what I’m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. I’m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and I’m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I can’t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion. I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didn’t matter, these are just a quality Comfortable Boot.Semper Fidelis;2/23/2016;4;TRUE;85;Trans Woman;Straw - Regular
243;243;243;1.2;"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer.";11/07/2016;9;TRUE;44;Transsexual Woman;Soup Campbells Split Pea And Ham
244;244;244;3.3;I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.  Too bad.;7/22/2021;89;TRUE;64;Neutrois;Sugar - Invert
245;245;245;1.4;I've owned over 10 pairs of Dan Post boots. Yes, I'm a big fan of them. I enjoy wearing Western-styled clothes and boots. I'm also a truck driver, and a biker. These boots fit the bill for all of these. Right out of the box, they look great, and are very comfortable. I wear a 12D. I ordered a 12D, and the fit is spot on. No problems at the heel, arch, or toe. They're listed as Waterproof. Haven't put that to the test yet. They're not as heavy as I thought they'd be. Very nice boot, easy to get used to, and looks great. I gave them a good treatment of Leather Honey, to condition the leather, and give them some extra protection. All in all, a great boot. I have no issues with them. They're Dan Post boots---great boots, great quality, and great looks. As I titled this review, if you're considering these boots, buy them. A great all around boot.

246;246;246;3.3;I've owned these boots for two years and have worn them nearly every day.  From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I've given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don't wear these boots is when I'm working-out or I'm hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out.

I started with New Balance WX1011 and WX1012 Cross trainers for tennis based on recommendation from my local New Balance specialty shop.  WX 1011 and 1012 were light weight mesh, flexible with good lateral support and soles that were not too stiff.  As a replacement shoe, New Balance recommended this 966v3 shoe. This is one of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on.  It is stiff, it presses across the toes and causes pain and the soles are too thick and stiff for quick movement on the tennis court.;2/17/2015;51;FALSE;43;Cisgender Woman;Chocolate Bar - Oh Henry

Within 2 months of use the area near my toe got damaged & I had to get leather patch glued to it (from inside) to prevent further damage (clearly visible on both shoes).Within 4 months heel support area got worn out (refer picture) causing pain in heel.For the price, this shoe should have lasted 2 years, but it did not last 4 months.I run / walk average of 5 to 8 km daily, normally my shoes last over 5 years, but I was expecting this shoe to last at least 2 years.;10/31/2020;39;TRUE;23;Neutrois;Chocolate - Chips Compound

301;301;301;4.7;You get what u pay for. Decent for the price. Very basic shoe. If you want a neutral shoe which u can use for commute as sneaker and use it for ocassional short distance run then it might suit u. Cushioning is provided by fresh foam which is decent but not as plush. Not much of a tech goes into it. Like it doesn't have hard plate in mid sole which keeps ur midfoot stable or say solid heel lock is missing. No extra layers of protection, in terms of cushioning in the sole. Laces are just basic. Build quality is ok but not great. Not suitable for broad feet. Decent but I think Asics Gel Nimbus and Mizuno Waverider are miles ahead of it in terms of neutral road running shoe. Waverider 19 is still the most value for money product here in India. Gel Nimbus are bit expensive.

317;317;317;1.0;First, these are good looking shoes, they fit pretty well, and the sole has pretty good grip.  What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level.

Instead, what you get appears to be less than a 1/4 inch of cushioning.  After playing a few games on a hard court, my knees were extremely sore.  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing.  I would not recommend to anyone who values their joints.;3/28/2021;63;TRUE;82;Agender;Mangoes

369;369;369;2.8;Ok, so normally New Balance shoes run a little small. My normal running shoes are Asics Gel Kayano 11.5 4E width. That is my absolute standard when it comes to fit and feel.When I usually purchase New Balance shoes, I get size 12 4E. Even then, its can be slightly short, but tolerable.  With these shoes, I started with the 12 4E. But man do they run long. The width seemed to be pretty accurate though.So I went with the 11.5 4E instead. They fit almost perfectly, except MAYBE a little long in the toes. However, I believe it were a size down, it would be a little too short.These are absolutely awesome on outdoor pickleball courts.

382;382;382;2.6;"After measuring my foot, following the size chart and ordering a 7, I could barely fit my foot in the shoe. Turns out I have an incredibly high instep, so I went a full size up to the 8. Fit like a glove! The arch support was in just the right spot - I've NEVER felt so supported by any boot before, hiking or otherwise. There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!! I feel like I'm wearing sneakers.The other day I took them for a ""test walk"" through a local stream, and while I stayed mostly on the sandy/muddy bank, I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up. EXCELLENT! I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100% dry.I've gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots I've owned.

383;383;383;4.5;Don’t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. It’s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that I’m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didn’t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because it’s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  It’s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand, they offered me a replacement pair of boots, making good with their warranty.  It was a fight, but I am getting new boots from the manufacturer.;8/22/2019;2;FALSE;24;Other;Wasabi Powder

385;385;385;1.7;I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months I’ve had these boots and I’ve really loved them. They’ve got a nice tread that I’m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they don’t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isn’t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if I’m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when I’m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like I’ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, they’ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, I’ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when I’m wearing my summer weight socks, I’m not get boiling hot feet. So that’s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to “go” in my work boots.So far, they’ve been worth the investment!

386;386;386;2.9;I want to love these shoes, but there's one MAJOR flaw with the design of these shoes witch make these a dealbreaker for me. I've been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you're going down! All that time an money for product development, I'm surprised that this got overlooked. It's a bummer, because these would otherwise be great shoes! If you want an expensive pair of comfortable rugged shoes for walking on flat surfaces, then these would be fine.;6/17/2019;54;FALSE;72;Trans Woman;Oil - Macadamia
387;387;387;3.9;The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my foot’s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If you’re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these “too small”.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isn’t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary “feet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much I’m buying a second pair incase they’re discontinued.;08/01/2018;3;FALSE;46;Cisgender Male;Doilies - 8, Paper

391;391;391;1.6;I’m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable, good looking, daily wear all weather boots. I purchased these to try them out hoping they’d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldn’t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i don’t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know they’re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9’s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured I’d mention it. I love wearing these and didn’t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortable.*UPDATE*2 months in of almost daily wear, multiple outdoor range dates, 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet.

Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable.

Ho fatto così anche in questo caso e mi sono trovato bene.  È inutile girarci intorno, non si può dare una regola precisa perché dipende dalla forma del vostro piede. In questo caso trattandosi di stivaletti dovete tenere presente che se avete le caviglie grandi potrebbe essere un problema il numero in meno e allora conviene il vostro numero usuale.MATERIALILa pelle è sempre di buona qualità. Gli stivali non sono lucidi ma piuttosto opachi quindi se vi piace la pelle lucida optate per altri modelli. A me piacciono così.CONCLUSIONIBuon prodotto. Grazie alla scuola Geox che lascia respirare il piede si sta bene e non si suda, cosa difficile con altri tipi di stivaletti. Acquisto consigliato soprattutto in offerta intorno ai 50 euro! In quel caso da prendere subito.Spero abbiate gradito la recensione. Saluti!;07/08/2018;85;TRUE;51;Cisgender;Wine - Maipo Valle Cabernet

Ich habe in lang geschnittenen Herrenschuhen grundsätzlich eine Größe weniger wie in Turn- bzw Freizeitschuhen, was sicherlich auch an meinem schmalen Fuß liegt.Bezüglich vermeintlicher Kratzer auf den Schuhen, die hier auch als Foto gezeigt wurden, muss man sich keine Sorgen machen.

538;538;538;3.5;"These sneakers are attractive, lightweight, and the overall construction seems good. I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess. I've been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products.

They’d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. I’d say if you’re looking for a “house slipper” quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great.

631;631;631;4.4;"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future.";12/10/2017;63;TRUE;80;Transgender;Garlic Powder

I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I'm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I'm an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I've been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I've been happy every since.  So, don't be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting.;10/21/2017;42;FALSE;26;Androgynous;Rice - Wild
633;633;633;1.3;First I want to say that I am a woman and I buy men's shoes to get the width I need.  I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other, along with high arches.  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning.  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women's shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men's shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.  In this shoe a men's 7 wide was perfect.  No, you won't get the Vibram sole, but comfort was more important to me than the sole material.;07/08/2017;90;TRUE;63;Cisgender Male;Sauce - Caesar Dressing

I order 10.5 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes, but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 10.5 Merrell shoes. And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to $80 - so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon! Lesson learned! I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future. I paid the same on Amazon as Merrell's website, and the fit is not the same as I expect.

I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don't look too bad for ""old hiking shoes"" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren't ""pristine"" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them.

Hopefully, they will serve me well.On the downside, they are not exactly true to size: size 11 actually feels like 10.5.

708;708;708;1.9;"Ich habe inzwischen 150km im Hyperion Tempo absolviert. Vom 7km Fartlek, 10km Tempoeinheit und dem HM in 75% Pace - der Hyperion Tempo macht eine super Figur. Das Zusammenspiel von Dämpfung, Direktheit und Leichtigkeit ist aus meiner Sicht hervorragend. Doch der Reihe nach:Gewicht: Der Schuh ist nicht nur leicht, er fühlt sich auch genauso an und läuft sich, besonders bei schnellen km sehr gut. Die Mittelsohle ist nicht zu schmal aber das DNA Loft Material ist super und bietet ausreichend Dämpfung was nicht zu lasten des Gewichts geht.Dämpfung: Für reine Versenläufer ist der Schuh sicher nicht die beste Wahl, für Mittelfußläufer ist er meiner Meinung nach super. Die Dämpfung ist ausreichend, man spürt die Energierückgewinnung, wenn auch nicht so sehr wie bei einem Carbon-Schuh (kostet auch wesentlich weniger).Feedback: Die Sohle ist zwar nicht sehr dünn, aber sie gibt viel Feedback. So ist der Lauf auf sehr groben Schotterwegen eher gewöhnungsbedürftig. Auf Trailabschnitten sowie dem Asphalt spielt der Hyperion Tempo seine Stärken aus. Die Sohle ist sehr haltbar und nach den 150km ist noch kaum Verschleiss an der Außensohle zu sehen.Die Schnürsenkel sind sehr dünn und dürften etwas kürzer sein, selbst mit Runners Knot sind sie meiner Auffassung nach noch einen Tick zu lange.Alles in allem ein hervorragender schuh von Brooks - mit dem sich bei jedem Wetter laufen lässt und man lange (+650km) Spaß haben kann.Sofern die Rezension hilfreich war, freue ich mich über ein Daumen nach oben ;-)";02/12/2018;43;TRUE;59;Transgender Person;Sauce - Fish 25 Ozf Bottle

I buy size 11- Wide in everything I buy,Skechers,work boots etc.I like to ensure room for expansion and insert foot beds if needed. I bought sof sole gel insoles here on Amazon also.These arrived today, I ordered 11 X-W  They showed on order as 11 4E {?} Length is good,width is slightly snug with or without replacement insoles. If you truly have a wide foot,good luck. Otherwise the insoles are tacky stuck down but are removable,inserts make a big difference. Quality is good,bright white,look nice and yes I would recommend;12/19/2016;68;TRUE;49;Male to Female;Buffalo - Short Rib Fresh
745;745;745;3.6;These are fire I love them! I was scared when ordering these because they’re so cheap - less than $30 I thought they wouldn’t be authentic or made out of plastic. These are authentic, the box was in good condition all labels were on. They feel great when I put them on and I don’t see any signs of them being fake. Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good. I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap! I get mad compliments. I’m buying all these colors and will post the results. I would say that they are slightlyyyy narrow just a little. So if you have fat feet that may effect you. I didn’t let that effect the rating cause I don’t have that problem.

The grip from the shorter cleats also work well for a kid on grass (even a bigger one like mine).

If your child as a more average size foot, I would say you could size up at least 1/2-full size if they are on the cusp of that growth spurt.

885;342;1887;3.2;My son was excited for these shoes. Unlike others, I WAS looking for velcro, because although he knows how to tie his shoes, he would rather slip them on and off, and I would rather still have a decent, rather then broken heel of his shoe. Turns out the heel was not the problem!! Instead, the toe part (it is cloth-woven on top of a more solid base) of the shoe began to unravel a couple months into wear, and now it looks completely frayed (over an inch or so) and tacky, revealing the plastic form of the shoe underneath. Otherwise the shoe has held up great, the white part in the front is fine, the tread on the bottom, it fits, he loves it, etc, but he will be getting a new pair of a DIFFERENT shoe, because I am not taking my chances on this pair again.;06/06/2006;182;FALSE;116;Transgender;Energy Drink Red Bull

We bought several pairs of the Reebok ATV after my oldest son saw the great commercial for them and decided he had to have a pair.  My boys wore the crap out of them and loved every minute of it.  Please bring those shoes back.  We have been hooked on Reebok for their comfort and durability ever since.I bought each of my boys a pair of the Yourflex Train 10s for Christmas to wear to school and for Gym class.  The different colored tread on the bottom of the shoes have begun to come undone after two days each.  It was obviously added last in the factory in order to enhance the appearance, but is a complete fail as it has lowered the functionality of the shoe tremendously.I've seen this happen with other shoe companies that attempt the same visual tactic.  In the future, I will not buy any shoe that screws around with the sole like this.  I'm disappointed Reebok.  I've grown to expect more from your company.

927;593;1844;3.6;"The sizing chart is wierd because it's Unisex Sizing. My foot is 9""x3"" and according to the listing's size chart, I should order a Men's 5/Woman's 6. However, I'm a US Woman's Size 7/7.5 and can wear a Men's 5.5/6.Since this seller offers free returns, I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 (in case the sizes were Men's) and a Size 7 (in case the sizes were Woman's) so I could compare fit.The Size 6 was too snug and short. The Size 7 fits well, lengthwise but is a tad wide. I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis. The shoes do not come in a box, they come in a nice little bag - which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohl's (although, since I have a printer, I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bag).A previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes. I can see how that could happen because the 3D-Knit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft. Literally, the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet. The collar of the shoe is so flimsy, a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot. So, it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 10-15 mins per mile. There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity. These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit, Nike Flyknit or similar type of slip-on sneakers.However, it's a very comfortable, light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks. It is a great grab and go shoe and, unlike the higher end brands names, I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy on/easy off and won't make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotel.The listing photos do not so the shoe justice. They are cute, fashionable and comfortable. I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the $150 price point.If you plan on doing a lot of walking (over 5 miles), I'd recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact (or wear a performance walking shoe instead). That being said, I recommend these Sneakers as a low-cost option for travel because they are light weight, great for casual walking, easy to pack, and perfect for security check points.NOTE: I was NOT compensated in any way for my review. I paid full price for the pair I'm wearing in the photo.

316;534;1799;4.4;Our 11 year old has big feet! LOL!  Had trouble finding shoes wide enough.  I know that New Balance is a good brand, and have worn them myself before.

These don't hurt his feet and they are good solid comfortable shoes.  It's important to have good shoes that fit for your child...and they you want to be as cost effective as possible because they need a new pair every 6 months.

The first thing I noticed, pulling the shoes out of the box, was a faint yellow stain on the right shoe and some yellowing in the laces. It really isn't a big deal, since it kind of goes with the vintage vibe(ish) but when I tried the shoes on, they were SUPER wide in the front, and only in the front. In all fairness, I have really narrow feet, but my other pair of Sperry's fit me perfectly fine so I'm not sure if they changed something up.

I’m not really a runner, I bought these shoes mostly for style but i gotta say I never realized how much a shoe matters in running until I bought these. Definitely good for running.

715;494;1149;1.1;I had a new pair of these and my college D1 athlete came home due to the quarantine - she’s a swimmer - suddenly turned runner, she swiped my shoes.  Took me a while to find the exact shoe but I did and now I have my running shoes back.  Very hard to purchase shoes when you can’t try them on.  These shoes have a soft upper that does not rub or irritate and they have a soft wide heel for the trail running I like.  They are a bit heavy but that is because the heel is solid.  The laces are a bit odd for a runner but once adjusted the upper combined with the shock absorption of the soul of the shoe makes it worth the time.  I have a narrow heel and it slips if not tied properly.  I am a size 10 and I have enough room in the toe for long runs.;6/15/2000;976;FALSE;112;Male;Myers Planters Punch

520;247;1308;4.0;Updated: after finally breaking these shoes in (it took longer than expected), I changed my review from 1 star to 4. I still think the ultra boosts are better and have an extra bounce but overall these shoes are quite comfortable and great for running and walking.Original review: I decided to try the pureboost for a walking shoe since I absolutely love my adidas ultraboosts (I have had six pairs for running). I assumed they would be similar but they are not at all. I wore them out for a 5 mile walk and they destroyed the back of my heel. The shoes are not comfortable. If you are between these and the ultraboosts i highly recommend spending the extra money to get the ultraboosts.

I was getting out of my car and bumped the door with my foot resulting in a small hole in the shoe at the toe. Nothing you can do to fix it. So now water comes in and you can see your foot or sock if white. I missed the return date by one day. Too much money to get holes in them.

The sole has nice cushion, but the toes area doesn't as much like the sneaker has an incline making it uncomfortable to walk in for a long period of time. The style and colors I love.

725;209;1565;4.2;"I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis; severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than these.TL;DR -- don't buy if you wear custom orthotics, don't buy if you pronate, don't believe they will stretch when you try them on.";10/20/2004;279;TRUE;73;Male;Rice - Wild

371;19;1845;4.8;Zunächst vorneweg, der Schuh ist super, passt wie erwartet und ist komfortabel und schick. Verarbeitungsqualität lässt keine Wünsche offen. D.h. der Schuh selbst verdient keine 1-Stern Bewertung, aber man kann nur das Produkt bewerten und nicht das Kauferlebnis selbst. Das ist ja grundsätzlich bei Amazon hervorragend und ich bezeichne mich selbst eher als Amazon-Junkie als Amazon-Kunde, aber was diesmal mit der Prime-Wardrobe Bestellung passiert ist, ist denke ich eine Rezension wert, denn das geht gar nicht, weiß nicht so recht wo der Fehler ist, das muss Amazon versuchen zu lösen. Folgendes ist passiert: Sehe den Schuh zum sensationellen Preis von 79 EUR (bei Zalando war er deutlich teurer) und lege ihn in den Warenkorb. Es wurde mir angeboten direkt zu dem Preis zu kaufen oder in Wardrobe zu dem Preise zur Anprobe. Denke mir nichts und lege ihn in Wardrobe, könnt ja sein, dass er nicht passt, also nutze ich doch den komfortablen „Zur-Probe Bestellweg“. Schwups bestellt und bekomme per Mail die Bestätigung, aber ohne Preis (0,00 EUR wurde abgebucht) steht da nur in der Bestätigung, denke mir nichts, denn habe ja für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt, also wird es schon passen. Drücke nochmal auf den Artikel und sehe Preis liegt jetzt bei 87 EUR, ok denke ich, da habe ich ja nochmals Glück gehabt und einen richtig guten Preis bekommen. Denkste! Heute Schuh bekommen, passt perfekt, also gleich ins Amazon-Konto und Schuh behalten drücken, aber was steht da. Schuh für 87 EUR kaufen oder zurückschicken. Hmm, aber ich habe doch für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt und bestellt. Aber nirgends ist ein Beweis dafür zu finden. Im Kundenkonto steht 87 EUR und in der Bestätigungsmail kein Preis. Habe das doch nicht geträumt, also Kundenservice angerufen, aber nichts zu machen. Ich kann gerne zurückschicken, die 87 EUR ist der Preis. Ok, das war kein besonders gutes Kauferlebnis, muss ich jetzt die Preise abfotografieren nach der Bestellung. Na egal habe den Schuh trotzdem bezahlt, er war auch mit 87 EUR sehr günstig, aber ähnlich Zalando (89 EUR) was aber gar nicht entscheidend ist wegen ein paar EUR mehr oder weniger. Aber sehr unbefriedigend ist schon, das man Artikel zu einem bestimmten Preis in den Warenkorb legt und dann offensichtlich ohne es zu merken oder den Preis bestätigt zu bekommen zu einem anderen Preis bestellt bzw. dann den Kauf abschließen muss. Das geht so nicht! Habe definitiv beim Abschicken der Bestellung (Knopf jetzt Bestellen) den Preis von 79 EUR angezeigt bekommen und erwarte dann auch, dass ich zu dem Preis kaufe und kein anderer, auch wenn Preise „im Hintergrund“ schwanken. Aus meiner Sicht ein Fehler im System und für mich ein Grund Wardrobe nicht zu nutzen. Also Vorsicht beim Bestellen über Wardrobe! Keine Ahnung ob ich ein Einzelfall bin oder andere auch schon diese Erfahrung gemacht haben, definitiv muss Amazon aber hier am System nachbessern.;10/03/2013;656;FALSE;96;Female;Alize Gold Passion

227;231;1994;3.2;"Written this before but it always bears repeating: I. HATE. These kinds of reviews.They're loafer style sneakers. They're black loafer style sneakers. They're a nothing fancy wardrobe mainstay that you really don't think about much. They wear out and you get new ones so, what in the heck can you say other than that? Lol.Design-wise, they were smart and put in a scant little inch in the heel. An inch isn't noticeable in the slightest- you don't even conciously feel it but, when you have a tendon problem in your foot or heel... OMFG does that little inch make all the difference!!!The designer was also thoughtful enough to make the interior sole ever so slightly fuzzy. Anyone who has *ever* gone without socks in warm weather (pretty common to do in this style of shoe) know why that's a nice detail that is sadly lacking in a surprising number of shoes.I know that doesn't bother a lot of women because they have forced themselves to get used to it but those hard interiors that make the inside all icky gross the *instant* your body even *thinks* about sweating drive me bonkers. Lol.Maybe it's the 110F summers where I live but whatever the reason, I am always grateful for an all cloth interior for an enclosed shoe. Lol.Anyway, there wasn't any breaking in for me on these. Another nice touch. I was able to wear them straight out of the box as if I had them for years.On the other side of things, they also seem to be wearing quite well.So, yeah, they don't look like anything special and, I guess in a way, they're kind of not but, they're nicely put together enough that you *don't* really think about them. Well, at least, you don't unless you're sitting in front of a blank Amazon Review screen which, for me at least, proves that they're actually a nice product that probably won't get nearly the reviews that they probably should. ;)";05/12/2003;818;TRUE;42;Non-binary;Mince Meat - Filling

Shoes aren't like clothes, I know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary. But in every other store on the planet earth I wear a size 8 (US).

335;320;1742;4.1;Pros: Made nicely, seem like comfortable, if it is your fit.Cons: Run large. My foot is 7 medium width, After reading the reviews I went from 7 (thats my Nikes, Sketchers-relaxed fit sneakers size), to 6.5 and they are still too big. Should have ordered at least 6. And still the fit is interesting. It is good that they have free return option with amazon prime, cause it is not so easy to find your fit. I am returning them and dont think I will order another size, cause they dont feel right for Zumba (slippery, no ankle support). But they might be good for other dancing lessons, like ballet for non-profs. If your foot is narrow, not high arch I would even recommend going from 7 to 6, cause in time they have a tendency to strech.

Fit as expected and good quality.theyve stood up to the last three months of rehearsals and still look great. For reference my daughter is a size 5-6 depending on the shoe.;4/14/2001;781;FALSE;115;Non-binary;Cheese - Bakers Cream Cheese
317;400;1873;3.2;"The shoe looks like it is three times too small....until you put it on and realize that it stretches at the arch area to allow you to have a hell under your heel and a pad under the ball of your foot.  Despite the heel and pad, you will feel as it you are barefoot, but that is part of the design, so buy it if that is what you are looking for.  If you want/need something rigid that will offer support all around your foot, this is NOT the shoe for you.  It is, essentially, a leather sock, with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on.  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last, then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface (floor contact) so that they last.  For the price, just order another pair when these wear out.  The fit is comfortable, however, you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe, at the very least, if not for odor management, then for comfort. The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe, where the pads of your toes rest, has NO insole, only rippled leather (extremely uncomfortable.  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1"" of the very tip of the front of the shoe, so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad.  Look at the pictures in the description.  Where you see leather ripples/ridges in the toe area....there is no liner, sole, or pad covering this area inside the shoe.  Your toes will not be happy.  An easy, cheap solution is to purchase, trim, and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe, and then you will be very happy with these shoes.  They are great for practicing or even dancing (socially), but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes.  Happy dancing!!";08/08/2012;316;TRUE;116;Non-binary;Coffee Swiss Choc Almond
617;831;1831;2.1;The shoes seem fine, but going by sizing guide they are too large.  Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch.  I don't know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose & sloppy.  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet.  While your toes need to be able to spread, you don't want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoe.Will need to return and order a smaller size.  I ordered 7 1/2 and I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 size street shoe, but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes.  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes.  Also, the lining inside one of the shoes was all bent up & would have been uncomfortable to wear.

738;193;1696;3.8;My son dances a lot for musical theatre. I just looked up this order and am amazed at how long they lasted, well over a year, but  the sole is getting worn down now.

For an adult or kid who dances more than him they will probably last for 6- 12 months.

944;695;1529;2.1;After reading many reviews, I decided to just do what the manufacturer suggested. I measured my daughter's foot, which heel to toe was exactly 9 3/4 inches. Based on the manufacturer's own guide, I ordered an 8.5 for her. In my gut I knew this had to be wrong, as she usually wears 7.5 or 8 max. But based on their own guidelines, I went for it. THEY. WERE. HUGE. HUGE. and HIDEOUS. I wear a 9 and they were HUGE on ME. She needed them asap, so I hop on and order a size 7.5, thinking an entire size down would be better. Wrong again. The 7.5 were better, but still and entire size too big for her. .At this point I gave up, took her to our local dance store and ponied up the $15 extra they cost there vs. these. They fit great and are much more attractive. I would not recommend these.

Just a little out there for an old lady but I like them.  The second pair fits great!  There are differences in where the shoes are made and who made  them and what day it is.  It’s a crap shoot.

I got the extra wide 10.5 and it still feels a little tight. The shoe strings are too short. I had another pair of NB shoes in pass that the string whee too short. I have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie. That pair was from 5-10 years ago. Thought they would know by now to make their strings longer.

This of course can be good for some people, as can the narrow toebox ( these would be great for one of my daughters, however they are not available in her size).  They do seem to be constructed well, and feel sturdy, although the sole is so light that it seems it would not hold up well over a few trail walks, but I have to return these so I won't be able to find out for sure about that.;11/22/2004;443;TRUE;32;Male;Blouse / Shirt / Sweater

The shoe is a bit narrow so if your feet swell from activity they may be a bit too tight at the end of your day.

2330;968;2153;1.9;"I love these shoes!!  However, they do seem run a little small; which is why I gave them 4 stars.  I usually wear a 7.5, which is what I ordered.  But I could tell when I first put them on that they were a little tight right up against my big toe. The first day was the worst one. They were already feeling tight but I jumped down to the ground from a platform to run to the car and as soon as I landed, my big toenails (and yes, they were cut) hit the toe of the shoe and I could feel that little bit of pain for the rest of the day.  It's day three and I can tell they've stretched a little bit, but next time I'll try an 8 to be on the safe side.  Otherwise, they are extremely comfortable.

So I got out my favorite blue suede 1100s for comparison (see pictures).1. The contours of the shoe were different from my blue pair of the 1100s2.and upon closer inspection, the insoles were also quite different.You can see in the pictures my trusty blue suede 1100s come with a more expensive removable insole. The difference in quality is clear. but only because I have an authentic pair from a reputable brick and mortar store to compare the convincing knockoff 1100s to are the differences made apparent.Don't get me wrong I don't mind low cost ""replicas"", but I paid almost 140 with taxes for these. This could just be a one-off, or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than I imagined. Maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic NB product?In any event, I highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer. Call ahead and ask if they have the 1100s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying. That's how I ended up with the blue ones.

Definitely not a walking shoe.So I've had these a couple of months now and thought I would share what I've found.The good - they are cool looking. i get comments every time I wear them and folks are surprised to see they are NB.They've gotten a bit more comfy as they have worn in some, but these are not shoes for being on your feet all day and they are definitely not a walking shoe. Good for casual wear.The bad - the sole (black rubber beneath the maroon sole) separated at the front on both shoes rather soon.

Die ist mir Superbegleitung beim Regenwetter gewesen, nur ist sie etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Daher habe ich mir überlegt, noch eine zu kaufen, war aber sehr enttäuscht. Die grüne Farbe ist etwas abgewandelt, aber das ist nicht sehr dramatisch. Nur die alte Jacke war aus einem sehr angenehmen und weichen wasserabweisenden Stoff. Die Jacken, die ich hier bestellt habe, sind hart und daher stehen sie ab und schmiegen nicht an Körper. Ausserdem wurde offensichtlich der  Schnitt geändert. Die Größe 36 sitzt jetzt anders, enger, unbequemer (auch des Stoffes wegen) und im Brustbereich extrem eng. Außerdem fehlen an der Jacke unter den Achseln zwei Öffnungen zur Durchlüftung.

2860;78;2649;2.3;Zunächst das Positive. Das Material fasst sich sehr gut an, riecht nicht und hat keinerlei Knitterfalten nach dem Transport. Die Farbe ist ein sattes Melonenrot, wirklich schön. Habe 2 Nummern größer bestellt und die Größe passt perfekt. Sie ist hinten länger und sieht wirklich gut aus. Sie hat tiefe Taschen, in die allerhand reinpasst. Als  Regenjacke kann ich sie aber überhaupt nicht empfehlen. Ich war 10 Min. bei leichtem Regen unterwegs und komplett nass an den Unterarmen und vor allem an den Schultern. Jeder Windzug geht durch. Der Futterstoff innen ist glatt und kühl. Das ist unangenehm vor allem in den Taschen. Nach dem Tragen braucht die Jacke ewig zum Trocknen. Ich habe Regenjacken für 1/3 des Preises, die funktionieren. Dies war ein Fehlkauf und ist einfach nur eine übermäßig teure rote Jacke.

2219;115;2990;2.2;Die Jacke ist echt hübsch.  Weil Leute schrieben, man soll sie größer bestellen, hab ich schon befürchtet, dass meine normale Größe zu klein sein würde und habe gleich 2 Jacken in Gr 52 und 54 bestellt.  Normalerweise trage ich eine 46/48. Ich hatte den Plan, einen dicken Wollpulli drunter zu ziehen.  Aber die 52 - also 2 Nummern größer  - ist einfach zu eng. Die 54 passt, aber mit Pulli wäre es zu eng. Habe beide zurück geschickt und jetzt eine 56 bestellt.An sich eine wunderschöne Jacke, die gut verarbeitet ist.  Das Material ist etwas steif. Die Farbe und Verarbeitung sind top. Aber die Größenangabe stimmt einfach nicht.Eine Nummer größer bedeutet dann aber auch, dass die Ärmel entsprechend länger sind.  Was sich auf dem Rad dann allerdings auszahlt.  Aber die Schultern sind halt auch breiter.  Aber mir gefällt die Jacke trotz dieser (grössentechnischen) Mängel sehr und ich freue mich auf die Lieferung der größeren Jacke.

2066;452;2309;4.9;Nice quality shoe but I have a couple problems with it that lead to a 2 start rather than 5.  BOA is using string instead of wire which it normally does and you’re not able to get a proper tight fit. Second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it. One of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the BOA strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness, which lends to a loose fit.  Folks who love and use BOA on their shoes will understand. Last major issue which is the shoe doesn’t have enough arch support, atleast IMHO. On the plus side the sole of the shoe is one of the nicest I’ve seen, but at this point, I’ll probably stick with Puma or FootJoy.;3/30/2002;293;FALSE;14;Non-binary;Cheese - Bocconcini

They all seem to be pretty close aside from these. They are a little big. The issue with is, for the most part they are meant to be worn without socks. The shoes being to big, and being worn without socks will cause the lacing system/tongue to bunch up and hurt.  I would say if you could, order two on amazon wardrobe.

You can easily tell which version you are looking at because the US version says ""Made in the USA"" on both the tung and side of the shoe. The non-USA version is more comfortable, but less durable. Also the USA version runs about 1 size small. I enjoy wearing both about equally. The US version is better for running, the international version is more suited for walking.

Went down half a size and they were fairly tight. I stuck with the smaller size since I don’t want to wear socks with them and the hope they’d break in just a little (they have just a bit). This shoe runs slightly narrow in the toe box and no support for running which I assumed before buying. They aren’t as “breathable I thought they would be as well. The biggest issue I’ve had is even just walking my dog in them the insoles constantly would move. I’d have to take off my shoe and adjust it multiple times in just a few miles (I had to glue them down). I really love the look, but if you’re actually moving in them they don’t perform.

I got about what I expected, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.the uppers are all an elastic material Nothing hard even above the heel. You slip them on like a slipper. the laces do nothing and are just for show. Elastic pulls your feet tight against the sole. So it is essentially like a slipper with a shoe sole. Unfortunately, that make them kind of hot. It is a little hard to get the shoe on without getting a wrinkle in your sock and that will make your feet hurt after a little while. The thing I like least about the shoe is that it feels and sounds like you are walking in galoshes. they flap a little when you walk.They are not terrible and they look good.

   Ho acquistato queste scarpe per il mio bimbo. La qualità è Geox: scarpe robuste, leggere, traspiranti e prodotte con materiali di qualità. Il piede non suda e le chiusure con il velcro tengono e sono solide. La suola è flessibile e ti rendi conto immediatamente che è comoda e di pelle! Anche dopo aver indossato le scarpe per qualche ora, non ho notato segni rossi sui piedini.Il design è prettamente sportivo,carino e si presta ad un uso quotidiano. Il colore è strepitoso, blu e rosso...a mio avviso sono più belle viste dal vivo!!!E poi vogliamo parlare delle luci LED? Il mio bimbo quando le ha viste è impazzito di gioia e ora vuole mettere solo queste scarpe! Comodissimo il tasto on/off per le occasioni più ""sobrie"".Sono molto carine indossate con jeans e felpa, ma anche con dei più pratici joggers. Peraltro le ho prese in promozione e quindi le ho pagate poco rispetto ai prezzi esposti nei negozi monomarca.La taglia corrisponde a quella delle scarpe abituali del bimbo.Consigliatissime per tutte quelle occasioni in cui occorre praticità.Ottimo anche il rapporto qualità prezzo.5 stelle meritate e riacquisto futuro delle Geox garantito!Dai un'occhiata alle foto e al breve video che allego così da farti meglio un'idea sul prodotto.Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto nella tua scelta e se così fosse, fammelo sapere 👇!";8/26/2012;415;TRUE;76;Non-binary;Bread - Bagels, Mini

2169;48;2136;2.7;We received the incorrect size and sent them back to exchange for the correct size. I have sent several items back to Amazon and it has always been a smooth process. As for the shoes, I bought a pare for my 9 year old son who throws shot put and discuss. He has a very flat wide foot and they fit him perfectly without having to get a wide size. You want them to have a snug fit. Like most beginners he started throwing in heavy lugged running shoes and had a difficult time turning his hips. His PR’s have gone up since buying the shoes because he can simply transfer power more effectively. So if you have a beginning thrower these ASICS will boost their throws and confidence. They are also affordable for a younger thrower that will eventually grow and need another pair at some point. ASICS quality is also on point.

2078;336;2466;4.3;My new all-time fave shoes for lifting. I can really feel the difference in my connection with the ground. The first week I wore these, I PRd both my deadlift and my squat. Maybe just my mindset on those days but I do believe the shoes helped. They’re not only perfect for digging into the floor on heavy lifts, but they’re also super cute with shorts, jeans, leggings etc. I love em. I just absolutely love them. Wish I could find my size in some of the other colors because I would definitely add more of these to my “shoe collection.”  Some reviewers stated they’re like “clown shoes” because of the wide toebox- I do not find that to be the case but I do prefer a roomier toebox. Love the low profile (I loath thick soled sneakers). The first few wears I did notice a tightness across the top of the foot where the seam is but my the third time I wore them, they were broken in and are now my “close toed” shoe of choice. I found the fit to be very true to size. Love the color. And LOVE that the laces stay tied throughout my entire workout!;11/18/2022;199;TRUE;40;Non-binary;Wine - Magnotta - Bel Paese White

I wouldn't order a whole size up though so half a size is good.  These will help dig those heels on the ground during squats and deadlifts.  I am a powerlifter and have been looking for these shoes for so long.  Glad I found them now.  I think these are more superior to Converse.  Again, the only reason why I am taking a star off is due to the narrow fitting but I guess that's how the shoes will keep your feet from moving.;04/12/2019;477;TRUE;79;Intersex;Cream - 35%

I contacted Amazon right away and they instructed me to contact Adidas for a refund/exchange. I submitted my request to Adidas on July 11 as requested by Adidas customer service. When I didn't hear anything after a few weeks I emailed them again. Several emails sent asking about an update went ignored. I had to use the chat feature on the Adidas website to get an answer. I was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on August 26. I followed up with customer service again and I was told I would receive an email update after 5 business days (the time it takes to inspect the item) and then the gift card would be issued within 7 business days. This still has yet to happen. When I contacted customer service again, they now changed their story and said that because I didn't purchase the shoes directly from Adidas I would not receive my gift card until 20 business days after the shoes were received. I am now being told that I won't receive my gift card until September 23, which is 2 1/2 months AFTER I submitted all of the required information to Adidas to start this process.

2489;704;2675;1.8;"I have used Teva's since the 90's, but when my last pair died I decided to get something that looked a bit less ""dad sandal"" despite now being a father.  I'd heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge.  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing.  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there.  I'm normally a size 9 in shoes, but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfect.Things I've noticed:  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that aren't using Velcro.  My feet appreciate that.  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you.  It's also a very wide last, which is good for my hobbit feet, but wouldn't work well if yours were long and narrow.  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time, but also take a few days to break in properly.For me, they fit well and are very comfy to wear.  I'm happy with the style of them as well.  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on.

2125;290;2474;3.9;I purchased this pair because I wanted another sneaker from Ecco, but I wanted something that was a slip-on with a less traditional style than the lace-up sneaker of which I have 5 pair from Ecco in various colors, and this fit the bill.  As with all Eccos, I can fit my custom orthotic inside with ease and somehow it does not compromise the fit of the shoe whatsoever (I wear a half orthotic which only supports the heel and arch of my foot and does not go to the toe).  The arch support without the orthotic is fair on its own and the bottom is more flexible than the other Ecco sneakers that I have, but I expected that with the style of this shoe and was what I wanted.  The sole of this shoe is not rigid so if you need that this will not provide that for you.  It is an extremely light shoe and breathable which is perfect for the warmer months.  Lately these are the pair that I grab the most and get a lot of compliments on them. They’re different than the average sneaker. They are sleeker and extremely comfortable and work with a lot of outfits, obviously more casual looks but I did wear them with skorts and cute top on vacation recently and they were perfect.  Also, great at airports when you need to slip your shoes off when going through security and super comfortable when you’re just sitting in your seat for hours on the plane ride, and really light to pack.

I am slow to criticize on fit since I am just figuring out variable sized footwear.  But even compared to other Propet footwear, this one is much narrower.  The photo is two right Propet shoes, both size 14 and width 5E.  Note that the strap of the black shoe completely covers the Velcro, but the grey sneaker was close to not being wide enough with about an inch of Velcro showing.
